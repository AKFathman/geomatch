# Dram

A mobile app for whiskey drinkers: log what you've tried in seconds, rank it Beli-style with quick "which did you prefer?" comparisons, go deep with notes and an expert scoresheet when you want to, discover through friends, and keep track of every pour at a tasting event.

> Status: **M0 — foundation built, not yet deployed.** See [`docs/05-roadmap.md`](docs/05-roadmap.md).

## How ranking works (the 30-second version)

1. Pick a tier: 😍 Loved · 🙂 Liked · 😐 Fine · 👎 Not for me.
2. Answer a few "which did you prefer?" questions against whiskeys already in that tier (binary search, ≤ ⌈log₂(n+1)⌉ questions).
3. Your list updates; every whiskey's 0–10 score is derived from its position (`supabase/migrations/20260917000300_rankings_tastings.sql`, mirrored in `apps/mobile/src/lib/ranking.ts`).

Everything else — notes, flavor tags, photos, the 100-point scoresheet — is optional and never changes your ranking.
